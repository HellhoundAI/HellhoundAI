The aim of the Hellhound AI project is to perform a detailed behavioral analysis of users of the study system of the University of Economics in Prague
and to detect anomalies in their daily behavior using machine learning algorithms. 
The reason for this analysis is to detect suspicious behavior of users whose login details have been compromised or who are themselves committing illicit use of the study system. 
The result will be a prototype system with artificial intelligence elements that would be able to detect these anomalies on a daily basis. 
The challenge will not only be to build a system for one-time detection of suspicious behavior, but we would also like to include the ability to learn in the algorithm.
